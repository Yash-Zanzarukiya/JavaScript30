      <h1>Saphala Ekadasi</h1>

      <p>
        Yudhisthira Maharaj said, "O my Dear Lord Sri Krishna, what is the name
        of that Ekadasi that occurs during the dark fortnight of the month of
        Pausha (December-January)?
      </p>
      <p>
        How is it observed, and which Deity is to be worshipped on that sacred
        day?
      </p>
      <p>
        Please narrate these details to me fully, so that I may understand Oh
        Janardana."
      </p>

      <p>
        The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krishna then replied, "O best of
        kings, because you desire to hear, I shall fully describe to you the
        glories of the Pausha-krishna Ekadasi.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I do not become as pleased by sacrifice or charity as I do by My
        devotee's observance of a full fast on Ekadasi. To the best of one's
        ability, therefore, one should fast on Ekadasi, the day of Lord Hari.
      </p>
      <p>
        "O Yudhisthira, I urge you to hear with undivided intelligence the
        glories of Pausha-krishna Ekadasi, which falls on a Dwadasi.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I explained previously, one should not differentiate among the many
        Ekadasis.
      </p>
      <p>
        O king, to benefit humanity at large I shall now describe to you the
        process of observing Pausha-krishna Ekadasi.
      </p>

      <p>"Pausha-krishna Ekadasi is also known as Saphalaa Ekadasi.</p>
      <p>
        On this sacred day one should worship Lord Narayana, for He is its
        ruling Deity.
      </p>
      <p>
        One should do so by follow the previously described method of fasting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as among snakes Shesha-naga is the best, and among birds Garuda is
        the best, among sacrifices the Ashvamedha-yajna is the best, among
        rivers Mother Ganges is the best, among gods Lord Vishnu is best, and
        among two-legged beings the brahmins are the best, so among all fasting
        days Ekadasi is by far the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        O foremost of kings who took your birth in the Bharata dynasty, whoever
        strictly observes Ekadasi becomes very dear to Me and indeed worshipable
        by Me in every way.
      </p>

        class="align-left slide-in"
      />

      <p>
        Now please listen as I describe the process for observing Saphalaa
        Ekadasi.
      </p>

      <p>
        On Saphalaa Ekadasi My devotee should worship Me by offering Me fresh
        fruits according to time, place and circumstance, and by meditating on
        Me as the all-auspicious Supreme Personality of Godhead. <br />
        He should offer Me jaambira fruit, pomegranate, betal nuts and leaves,
        coconut, guava, varieties of nuts, cloves, mangoes, and different kinds
        of aromatic spices. <br />
        He should also offer Me incense and bright ghee lamps, for such an
        offering of lamps on Saphalaa Ekadasi is especially glorious. <br />
        The devotee should try to stay awake the Ekadasi night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now please hear with undivided attention as I tell you how much merit
        one gets if he fasts and remains awake throughout the entire night
        singing and chanting the glories of Narayana. <br />
        O best of kings, there is no sacrifice or pilgrimage that yields merit
        that is equal to or better than the merit one gains by fasting on this
        Saphala Ekadasi. <br />
        Such fasting - particularly if one can remain awake and alert the entire
        night long - bestows the same merit upon the faithful devotee as the
        performance of austerity for five thousand earthly years. <br />
        O lion among kings, please hear from Me the glorious history that made
        this Divine Ekadasi famous.

      <p>
        Once there was a City called Champaavati, which was ruled by the saintly
        King Mahishmata. <br />
        He had four sons, the eldest of whom, Lumpaka, always engaged in all
        manner of very sinful activities - illicit sexual encounters with the
        wives of others, gambling, and continual association with known
        prostitutes. <br />
        His evil deeds gradually reduced the wealth of his father, King
        Mahishmata.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lumpaka also became very critical of the numerous devas, the empowered
        universal attendants of the Lord, as well as toward the brahmins, and
        every day he would go out of his way to blaspheme the Vaishnavas. <br />
        At last King Maahishmata, seeing the unrepentant brazen fallen condition
        of his son, exiled him to the forest.
        <br />
        Out of fear of the king, even compassionate relatives didn't come to
        Lumpaka's defense, so angry was the king toward his son, and so sinful
        was this Lumpaka.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://wallpapers.iskcondesiretree.com/wp-content/wallpapers/iskcon_chowpatty/003-Sri_Gaurachandra_Feet_-_450x800.jpg"
        height="500px"
        class="align-left slide-in"
      />

      <p>
        "Bewildered in his exile, the fallen and rejected Lumpaka thought to
        himself, 'My father has sent me away, and even my kinsmen do not raise
        but a finger in objection. What am I to do now?' <br />
        He schemed sinfully and thought, 'I shall sneak back to the city under
        cover of darkness and plunder its wealth. During the day I shall stay in
        the forest, and as night returns, so shall I to the city.'
      </p>

      <p>
        So thinking, the sinful Lumpaka entered the darkness of the forest.
        <br />
        He killed many animals by day, and by night he stole all manner of
        valuable items from the city. <br />
        The city-dwelling folk apprehended him several times, but out of fear of
        the king they left him alone. <br />
        They thought to themselves that it must have been the accumulated sins
        of Lumpaka's previous births that had forced him to act in such a way
        that he lost his royal facilities and became to act so sinfully like a
        common selfish thief. <br />
        "Though a meat-eater, Lumpaka would also eat fruits every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        He resided under an old banyan tree that unknown to him happened to be
        very dear to Lord Vasudeva. <br />
        Indeed, many worshipped as the demi-god (representative departmental
        head) of all the trees in the forest. <br /><img
          src="https://wallpapers.iskcondesiretree.com/wp-content/wallpapers/iskcon_baku/001-Sri_Gaura_Close_up.jpg"
          height="250px"
          class="align-right slide-in"
        />
        In due course of time, while Lumpaka was doing so many sinful and
        condemnable activities, the Saphalaa Ekadasi arrived. <br />
        On the eve of the Ekadasi (Dasami) Lumpaka had to pass the entire night
        without sleep because of severe cold that he felt due to his scanty
        bedclothes (bedding).
      </p>
      <p>
        The cold not only robbed him of all peace but almost of his very life.
        By the time the sun rose, near dead, his teeth chattering and near
        comatose. In fact all that Ekadasi morning, he remained in that stupor
        and could not awaken out of his near comatose condition. "When midday of
        the Saphalaa Ekadasi arrived, the sinful Lumpaka finally came to and
        managed to rise up from his place under that banyan tree. But with every
        step he took, he stumbled and fell to the ground. Like a lame man, he
        walked slowly and hesitantly, suffering greatly from hunger and thirst
        in the midst of the jungle. So weak was Lumpaka that he couldn't even
        concentrate to nor muster strength to go and kill even a single animal
        that whole day. Instead, he was reduced to collecting whatever fruits
        had fallen to the ground of their own accord. By the time he returned to
        his banyan tree home, the sun had set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Placing the fruits on the ground next to him (at the base of the sacred
        banyan tree), Lumpaka began to cry out, 'O, woe is me ! What should I do
        ? Dear father, what is to become of me? O Sri Hari, please be merciful
        to me and accept these fruits as an offering !' Again he was forced to
        lie awake the whole night without sleep, but in the meantime the all
        merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Madhusudana, had become
        pleased with Lumpaka's humble offering of forest fruits, and He accepted
        them. Lumpaka had unwittingly observed a full Ekadasi fast, and by the
        merit he reaped on that day he regained his kingdom with no further
        obstacles. "Listen, O Yudhisthira, to what happened to the son of King
        Maahishmata when but a fragment of the merit spouted up within his
        heart. "As the Sun beautifully rose in the sky on the day following
        Ekadasi, a handsome horse approached Lumpaka as if seeking him out, and
        stood next to him.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://wallpapers.iskcondesiretree.com/wp-content/wallpapers/iskcon_amritsar/017-Sri_Sri_Radha_Gokulananda_Close_up_-_1920x1080.jpg"
        width="500px"
        class="align-left slide-in"
      />

      <p>
        At the same time, a voice suddenly boomed out from the clear blue sky
        saying, 'This horse is for you, Lumpaka! Mount it and ride swiftly out
        of this forest to greet you family! O son of King Maahishmata, by the
        mercy of the Supreme lord Vaasudeva and the strength of the merit you
        acquired by observing Saphalaa Ekadasi, your kingdom will be returned to
        you without any further hindrances. Such is the benefit you have gained
        by fasting on this most auspicious of days. Go now, to you father and
        enjoy your rightful place in the dynasty.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon hearing these celestial words resounding from above, Lumpaka
        mounted the horse and rode back to the city of Champavati. By the merit
        he had accrued by fasting on Saphala Ekadasi, he had become a handsome
        prince once more and was able to absorb his mind in the lotus feet of
        the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. In other words, he had become
        My pure devotee.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Lumpaka offered his father, King Mahishmata, his humble obeisances and
        once more accepted his princely responsibilities. Seeing his son so
        decorated with Vaishnava ornaments and tilak (udhvara pundra) King
        Mahishmata gave him the kingdom, and Lumpaka ruled unopposed for many,
        many years. <br />
        Whenever the Ekadasi came, he worshipped the Supreme Lord Narayana with
        great devotion. And by the mercy of Sri Krishna he obtained a beautiful
        wife and a fine son. <br />
        In old age Lumpaka handed his kingdom over to his son - just as his own
        father, King Maahishmata, had handed it over to him. <br />Lumpaka then
        went to the forest to dedicate his concentrate attention to gratefully
        serve the Supreme Lord with controlled mind and senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purified of all material desires, he left his old material body and
        returned back to home, back to Godhead, attaining a place near the lotus
        feet of his worshipful Lord, Sri Krishna. <br />
        "O Yudhisthira, one who approaches Me as Lumpaka did will become
        completely free of lamentation and anxiety. <br />
        Indeed, anyone who properly observes this glorious Saphalaa Ekadasi -
        even unknowingly, like Lumpaka - will become famous in this world. He
        will become perfectly liberated at death and return to the spiritual
        abode of Vaikuntha. <br />
        Of this there is no doubt. Moreover, one who simply hears the glories of
        Saphala Ekadasi obtains the same merit derived by one who performs a
        Rajasurya-yajna, and at the very least he goes to heaven in his next
        birth, so where is the loss?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus ends the narration of the glories of Pausha-krishna Ekadasi, or
        Saphala Ekadasi, from the Bhavishya-uttara Purana
